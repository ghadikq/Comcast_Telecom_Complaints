## Stage 2: Developing a research question and analysis

I begin working on this project to work on the same dataset using both Python and R to have the same analysis and solve the same questions that come to my mind after exploring data I mainly focus on categorical data and try different things on it.<br />

This project helps me understand the limitation and advantages of Python,  R  and show me what is better to do in each language.<br />

## What done in this project?

- EDA<br />
- Clean dataset.<br />
- Organize dataset columns types and use DateTime type.<br />
- Provide a chart for specific criteria and use a different type of charts to represent the same criteria in Python and R.<br />
- Work with categorical values [orgnize, filter, count, change values, plot values with there counts and specify max and percentage].<br />

- Some experiment things I tried to do but it is not fully done and probably will work on it more in the future :<br />

NLP in Python:<br />
I used LDA and Word Cloud also several packages for text mining. I apply LDA Model to data and was able to extract the most used words and plot the result in the appropriate format for the LDA model.
I could extract 10 most used words and use them to help search through the complaints.

NLP in R :<br />
I tried to do the same concept I did in Python in R but I faced some difficulties and issues in NLP in R so I May work more on the NLP aspect more in the future.<br />

But my idea is to use clustering is to extract the most used words in complaints and try to have a column containing the types for each complaint for example if a complaint is a slow internet then it will have the complaint type as the internet.<br />
This can help the Comcast company classify complaints into different types and solve the problems in-depth and not only for this one complaint like if on a certain day all complaints about intent then there may be a problem with the company service.
